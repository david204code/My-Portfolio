    details: `
    In this project I used WordPress as a plaform to design a website that meets the needs
    of the client. Aside from designing the website, the client also requested I provide a
    simple manuel for their employees on how to constantly update their website in order 
    to ensure the information are up to date and relevant.
    In designing this website I choose the appropriate plugins that are well suitable in what
    the client requested.

    details: `
    With my HTML and CSS knowledge I used the bootstrap framework to create a fully functional live website
    from scratch. I worked closely with client to ensure I get every single detail right. Details such as layout,
    user navigation and general outlook was very important for success of the website.

    Build reusable components using JSX and JavaScript. This very website is THE project, please take a good
    look around. All this is a single-page app, meaning it still function like a normal website but loads 
    way quicker! React is one of the best upcoming web development technology, it was great using it and more
    importantly learning about it.
